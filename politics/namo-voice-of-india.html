<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Narendra Damodar Das Modi......................" said the newly elected prime minister of the world's largest democracy in the world, and the rest is not unknown to the citizens of India who chose him as their new prime
minister. Narendra Modi emerged as the leader of the majority in the elections, upon which the world has set
their eyes on, waiting as the Indian political drama unfolded, hoping a new leader will come who will change their
lives. The one whose punchline became "NAMO", the one who put an end to the virtual rule of "MAA BETE KI
SARKAR" did not become the person he is now, in a day nor in a month. So let's see the birth of "NAMO" and
how it became the voice of the nation.</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Indians are quite obsessed with a formal piece of writing that states that the person mentioned is educated or graduated from so and so institute on so and so subject. But ideology of Narendra Modi surpasses any such
obsession.A wanderer he became, when he left home at a tender age of 17 and travelled the roads deserted
by the followers of Swami Vivekananda. When the youngsters of his age were attending colleges for higher
education, Narendra Modi was grooming himself in the valleys of himalayas. No matter how strange it sounds, every person encounters someplace in their lives where they find their higher self-being, and I strongly believe
that the cladestine valleys of himalalyas made a profound impact on his way of thinking. It's quite rare to find
somebody ideolizing the unsung philosophers of the great Indian history and implementing it practically in their
own lives. So who was this great Indian personality who continues to inspire great leaders like Narendra Modi?
Yes, he was none other than Swami Vivekananda, and as mentioned earlier his teachings moulded the young
Modi. Just as a sculptor carves out a masterpiece from a piece of stone,young Modi developed an unparalled
set of beliefs and values from the teachings of his role model i.e. Swami Vivekananda. And this my friend was
the foundation so solid, that the person who runs our nation rests upon.
</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how capable one is, without the proper propulsion and guidance, the capability is as good as not having one. This is where RSS (Rashtriya Swyamsewak Sangh) enters the life of Narendra Modi. Narendra Modi
was a part of RSS from a very young age. After returning from Himalayas, gaining knowledge and wandering
various ashrams, Narendra Modi became a full-time active member of RSS. It was a point of political turmoil in
India, an emerging political party "Bhartiya Jana Sangh" came into being, with its roots intertwined with RSS! Not giving his life any chance of regret, Narendra Modi grabbed the opportunity and joined the newly found
party, and soon rose himself up under the godfathers of BJP i.e.Lal Krishna Advani and Atal bihari Vajpayee.
</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would wonder how this man in so less time in political arena is now swearing as the chief minister of Gujarat. But reality struck hard on the faces of those when the same man swore as the Prime Minister of India.
Between the time he was Chief minister and was planning on his debut on Indian national politics, Narendra
Modi's career had hit a few ditches.
</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreaded Godhra kaand happened shortly after his commencement of his term. This gave his political opponents salt to rub on Modi's fresh wounds. Stronger he emerges after a battle, he leaves no stone
unturned to again win back the hearts of his trusted voters. It was due to his persistent efforts that he was
nominated to run for Prime Minister in the general elections in 2014.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage was set,mob was all fired up and the sound of helicopter rotor blades sent a wave of enthusiasm to the crowd. Meanwhile, cameras turned towards the commotion to capture the person responsible for it. As he
made his way to the stage the enthusiasm of the mob gradually turned to whispers to listen to the speaker
, and he continued "MITTRON......." and suddenly the mob got mersimerised and agreed to every point their
leader made. Such was the impact Narendra Modi made on the citizens of India. Blame it on the prevailing
political situation or the command Modi held on voters, a majority of citizens came under the "NAMO" banner
to end the personified "MAA BETE KI SARKAR" rule in India. Such signature dialogues were widely accepted
by the "AAM AADMI". After 40 years the parliament identified any party (now, BJP) as the ruling majority party.
</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes the hard part, Was Narendra Modi worthy of every single vote he recieved? Well,this question, I leave it to my readers but I can help you come to a conclusion by stating some of the facts. It's been more than
2 years since Narendra Modi held his office and more than 7 years since India saw another 26/11. Never has
India conducted any surgurical attack on Pakistan until last year a covert operation beyond the line of control
was conducted in response to a cowardly terrorist attack on Pathankot Air Base and proved the mettle of this
great nation infront of this whole world. Unlike the last Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been highlighted
in the world of glamour and fashion. Twice he became the Times person of Year, many times been nominated
for Most Influential person in the world. After a long time Indians are viewed in the light of respected individuals
all around the world. At an elderly age, our Prime Minister takes decisions which could give any young leader a
cardiac arrest, a highly classified act of replacement of indian currency in a matter of 50 days is not a joke.
</p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present generation of India is very lucky to witness and appreciate these 5 years of Modi's rule. It's very likely to replace, the wars between India and Pakistan as bedtime stories for our coming generation. We as
citizens of India are responsible for its prosperity, so let's give one more voice to the double syllable word
which is going to inspire generations to come.
