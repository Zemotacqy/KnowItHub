<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Herod was the king of Judea under the Romans at that time. According to Jews, God is everywhere, they worshipped god in their temples (or church, as they used to call). But soon, everything was about to change, a boy king was prophesised to be born, a king who will rule not the minds of his people, but the hearts of his followers in the name of god. Today, more than 2 billion people follow him by the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Herod was an oppressive ruler (due to which he became the king of Jews under Romans). One night, he had a vision of a small boy being called by his followers &ldquo;The King of Jews&rdquo;. The King got worried and after consulting his high priests he ordered that all the small boys in his kingdom be killed. Order was obeyed. Meanwhile in Bethlehem, a baby boy named Jesus, unaware of world’s atrocities, was born to Mary and Joseph. On hearing King&rsquo;s orders, the family fled to city of Nazareth along with Jesus&rsquo;s cousins James and John.</p><br>

<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time flew by and Jesus got attracted to the world of philosophy and spirituality. He also worked at his father’s carpentry shop. His cousin John became a Baptist and James became the family&rsquo;s source of money. King Herod died and his incompetent son Antipas ruled under Roman Governor of Judea, Pilate. John, the Baptist once shared a vision with Jesus he had in the desert. He told Jesus that he was the prophesised &ldquo;King of the Jews&rdquo;. This prompted Jesus to follow the path of preaching and spirituality. </p>
<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Jesus assisted a fisherman named Simon in the sea Galilee. On the boat Jesus started praying, and soon the net was filled with fishes. Simon was awestruck and shared John’s views – that Jesus was god&rsquo;s own son [ remember: According to Jews, God is everywhere, they worshipped god in their temples]. Jesus himself was amazed, he started believing in himself.  Thus Simon - the fisher of men or Peter (named by Jesus) became the first follower of Jesus. John, the Baptist was imprisoned and executed as he was widely propagating the idea of Jesus. The High priests of Judea were not in favour of monotheistic god and hence challenged Jesus’s preaching. Meanwhile, people came to Jesus to cure themselves, some considered him a Sorcerer, some followed his way of life. Now, Jesus had made a large number of followers with his 12 most trusted followers, always by his side.  </p>
<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus proclaimed himself the son of god and urged people to follow him. He challenged the temple of High priests, which had now become the commotion of corrupt and greedy people. The High priests took onto offensive and planned to portray Jesus as a threat to Roman empire and have him crucified. The roman empire did not want Jesus to be crucified (he was no threat to them). Moreover, people loved Jesus, so it became difficult for them to kill Jesus. Judas Iscariot, one of the 12 most trusted followers of Jesus betrayed him for 30 silver coins. His name is sometimes used as a synonym for betrayal. Judas signalled Antipas&rsquo;s army to capture Jesus, by kissing him on his cheek.  </p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-justify font-weight-bold">&ldquo;So, I am finally betrayed with a kiss.&rdquo;, Jesus said.</blockquote>
<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous painting by Leonardo da-Vinci, <em>The Last Supper</em> is an iconic moment in Biblical accounts. This was the last meal of Jesus before being captured and betrayed by his follower. With Jesus in the centre, he is surrounded by his 12 followers including Judas Iscariot. It is believed that Jesus shared his bread with all his followers, with each follower taking a part of his soul (or say divinity). Jesus was sentenced to crucifixion by Pontius Pilate. He was first scrounged, then made to carry a heavy block of wood to the site of crucifixion. On his way he was continuously beaten by roman guards, spat on by people. Certain Biblical accounts consider this walk towards crucifixion as the &ldquo;King’s Glory&rdquo;. And why not, all his life Jesus preached nothing but love, forgiveness, glory, righteousness …. and considered suffering as his part of life. Finally, when Jesus was crucified, roman soldiers put on the cross <em>I.N.R.I (Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum)</em>. The shroud in which Jesus was covered in, is still preserved in Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist, Turin, Italy. After 3 days, when his followers visited his tomb, the shroud was left uncovered without Jesus! This day is celebrated as Easter every year.

<br><p>After death of Jesus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pontius Pilate was called back to Rome.</li>
  <li>Origin of Mary Magdalene -> Mary of Magdala (a city where roman barracks were stationed). She was close to Jesus, but no hard evidence of Jesus’s true bloodline has ever been found.</li>
  <li>Simon a.k.a Peter moved to Rome to preach Jesus’s teachings, but was in conflict with temple so later executed. He requested to be crucified upside down unlike Jesus. Jesus said to him – Oh Peter! You are the rock my church will stand fast on for generations to come. The most famous St. Peter Basilica is the proof!!!</li>
  <li>One of his 12 followers, Thomas was speared to death in India!</li>
  <li> Judas Iscariot hanged himself out of guilt.</li>
  <li>Rest all of his 12 followers were killed as they were challenging High priest’s temples. </li>
  <li>Christians -> Christ ins -> Christ/Kins!  Meaning siblings of Christ (an honorary title bestowed upon Jesus)</li>
  <li>According to a theory, Jesus after his resurrection travelled with his cousin James around the world and died somewhere in Kashmir.</li>
</ul><br>
